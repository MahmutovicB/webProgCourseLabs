This repo is made for my university course "Foundations of Web Development". It contains every lab work from first week all the way up to the week we are currently on. 
It also contains ASSIGNMENT 1 which is located in **assignment 1** folder, where you can find all material used to build this responsive web-site using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and TailWind CSS.
